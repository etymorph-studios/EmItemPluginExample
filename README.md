# EmItemPluginExample
Showcase how to use this project within a game. Live example on how integrators could use this plugin.

## Requirements

Must have the Em Item Plugin within your Unreal Engine 5.4 Marketplace Plugin folder.

## WIP
This project was created to be a living showcase of this plugin. To remove clutter from the plugin it self, but also to show how to utilize the software.
This project is currently bare-bones, but does showcase the plugin. More to come!
